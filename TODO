TODO LIST (in rough order)
==========

more levelQuests (get A, B, C mons to level Y)

timedEvents - trainer quest to add more pokeman to shop, pokemon eggs

add item for egg enabling and egg laying (INCENSE)

quantity quest - have X number of pokemons

Bring back the casino :( :( :(

quest and upgrade unlocking based on level

totalLevel quest (get X total levels between your party)

multiple save files to save to or load from

tradeQuest - take mon of level X and trade it for an unbuyable mon

item boxes - maybe? as quest rewards

quests view needs a selector (so you select the quest to see its description and get the option to complete it)

trainerQuest - give your potions and pokeballs and start a timedEvent that, when it finishes, deletes X potions and X pokeballs from inventory and adds a pokemon to the pokemon store

more pokemon that can't be bought from the pokemon store (obtained through quests instead)

shiny pokemons:
upgrade to make the active pokemon produce eggs as a timedEvent (but it'd only tick down for the pokemon that's currently active)

hatching egg adds 1 to the numAvailable in the store for that pokemon (meaningless for buyable pokemons, but good for unbuyable ones)

rare chance to hatch a shiny poke (which also adds to the store and has a perSecond rate equal to its nonshiny version; multiple quantity does nothing -- or make it just behave exactly like a single nonshiny poke, so that it's optional and not required to progress in game)

More upgrades, more items

rebalancing of numbers

Refactor things (everything) to be more clean. OH GOD EVERYTHING BREAKS.

Make stats pane have more stats. List upgrades bought.

Add content to the about pane.

Add more CSS to make things look nicer. Make items more pretty. 

Debug panel?? Or maybe just a debug setting or something.

Improve log panel to do that whole "xN" thing instead of duping the row


Nice to Have
============

Menu options, content in the about pane.

Changelog.

Import/export of saves

More styling on tooltips and the notice/alert message.

Tuning on the actual numbers, yeah right.

Cheevos.

Ascension. (resetting gives you small medals based on behavior, which can then be spent in the medal store for permanent upgrdes or to start with extra stuff)
