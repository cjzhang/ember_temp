==========

A thing to learn Ember with. Also a clicky game.


TODO LIST (in rough order)
==========

Saving. Probs just gonna shove it into local storage.

Content? Need more upgrades and items, need images for the extra mons, need the reskin to make it pokemon themed. Need to make the base numbers harder now that there's upgrades and stuff that make it easier.

Quests. Some sort of gambling system rolled in as part of them, maybe.

Refactor things (everything) to be more clean.

Make stats pane have more stats.

Debug panel?? Or maybe just a debug setting or something.

Improve log panel to do that whole "xN" thing instead of duping the row

Add more CSS to make things look nicer. Make items more pretty. 

Shiny pokemans.



Nice to Have
